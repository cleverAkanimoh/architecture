          heading={`WHY ${companyName} IS SO CHEAP?`}
          text="Well, all designs have been designed for clients based on their specific requirements - this means that any drawing sold here has already paid itself back by the time you get to download it. So in a way you can say we are recycling the designs. And yes, it is legal. All copyrights belong to the architects who designed the buildings, otherwise we would not be selling the drawings. For custom designs we negotiate with our clients and only publish designs that we have full rights to." />

          heading="READY MADE HOUSE PLANS"
